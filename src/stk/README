Intro
	This is a simple, small stack library written by Wyatt Carss. It operates
	on strings. Stack size should be theoretically boundless, and string size
	is set by a #define in "stack.h".

	It's memory-leak-free and so far as I know, bug-free at this point. I'm
	intending to use it to verify correct nesting of tags within an SGML
	document.

	Return values are a bit scattershot; they'd be a smart thing to make
	more logical. Also, I'd bet that I could have used strncmp instead of
	strcmp, given my #define for string size. If you want to make a buffer-
	ovverrun, there's your avenue for it :)

	Fun bit of work while watching Dr. Who on a Saturday night. 3-7AMish.

Build and Install:
	'make' to build
	'make clean' to remove objects and clutter
	'make cleanall' to leave just the sources.

API:
	Creation/Destruction:
		int new_stack(Stack *s)
		int kill_stack(Stack *s)
	Business Functions:
		int push(Stack s, char *str)
		int pop(Stack s, char *str)
		int peek(Stack s, char *str)
	Return Values:
		0	OK
		1	Failed (pretty general -- usually NULLs passed where not expected)
		2	Stack is empty (happens for pop and peek - str remains untouched)


Usage:

#include<stdio.h>
#include "stack.h"

int main()
{
	Stack s;
	char str[64];

	new_stack(&s);
	push(s, "on you go");
	push(s, "just like that");
	push(s, "and we're done");

	peek(s, str);
	printf("top of the stack says: %s\n", str);

	printf("Clearing it all away...\n");
	while(pop(s, str) != 2)
	{
		printf("Popped: %s.\n", str);
	}
	printf("All done!\n");

	kill_stack(&s);
	return 0;
}
